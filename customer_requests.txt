Our customer is the owner of a new gourmet restaurant called Eating Fire. 

The customer is willing to give us considerable creative latitude with the new website. All we have to do is:

1. Make use of at least some of the images in the images folder
2. The site should have sections talking about how good the food is, how good the ambiance is, and how good the wine is.
3. The site should be responsive and look great on both a widescreen monitor and on mobile devices
4. The customer has two fonts in mind, both from Google fonts. These fonts are linked to in the html and css templates provided
5. The customer says she would like her restaurant site to look "inspired by a wine label."

Bootstrap recommended. You've got two hours to deliver something awesome! No pressure.
